# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This Jupyter Notebook builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on medical data. It uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains 768 records and 9 features, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age.

Key Steps:
Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Removes null values and cleans data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizes feature distributions using matplotlib and seaborn.

Model Building:

Trains classifiers like Logistic Regression or Random Forest on the dataset.

Evaluation:

Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics to assess model performance.

This script provides insights into diabetes risk factors and predicts outcomes efficiently.
